- 4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil  
- 4 tbsp unsalted butter  
- 700g cremini mushrooms, trimmed and thinly sliced, stems reserved  
- 1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped (~170g)  
- 2 garlic cloves, finely minced  
- 300g pearled farro  
- 2 tsp soy sauce  
- 1 tbsp light miso paste  
- 175ml dry white wine
- 4 tsp chicken soup base  
- 1 bunch asparagus, trimmed and cut on the bias into 2-inch pieces  
- 30g finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, plus more for serving

- 1 lemon, zested and juiced

## Instructions

1. **Rinse and Soak Dried Mushrooms**: Rinse dried mushrooms in warm water to remove grit. Place in a small saucepan, cover with water, and bring to a simmer.  
2. **Cook Fresh Mushrooms**: Heat olive oil and butter in a pressure cooker over high heat until foaming subsides. Add fresh mushrooms, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until well browned (~8 min).  
3. **Add Rehydrated Mushrooms**: Remove rehydrated mushrooms from the pan, chop, and add to the pot. Reserve the soaking liquid.  
4. **Sauté Aromatics**: Add onion and garlic. Cook, stirring frequently, until onions are softened and aromatic (~4 min).  
5. **Toast Farro**: Add farro and cook, stirring, until evenly coated and toasted but not browned (~3 min).  
6. **Turn Up the Umami**: Add soy sauce, miso paste, and wine and cook, stirring, until the raw alcohol smell has cooked off and the wine has almost fully evaporated (~2 min).  
7. **Add Stock**: Measure the reserved mushroom soaking liquid and add water to make 850ml. Add to the pot with chicken soup base and stir to combine.  
8. **Pressure Cook**: Scrape down the sides of the pressure cooker. Close the lid and bring to high pressure. Cook at high pressure for 10 min, then remove from heat and allow pressure to release naturally for 10 min.  
9. **Brown Butter & Asparagus**: Meanwhile, melt 2 tbsp butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add asparagus and cook, stirring occasionally, until asparagus is bright green and tender-crisp and butter has turned nutty brown (~5 min). Stir in lemon zest and juice. Remove from heat.
10. **Finish Risotto**: Open the pressure cooker, stir in cheese and herbs, and season with salt and pepper. Stir vigorously until creamy. If too thin, cook for a few minutes longer, stirring until thickened. If too thick, stir in some hot water.  
11. **Serve**: Serve immediately, topped with asparagus, a drizzle of brown butter, shaved parmesan, and more herbs.
