# Champiñones Rellenos

*An ode to Mesón del Champiñón in Madrid. Juicy, smoky tapas perfect for a party.*

## Ingredients

- 16oz (450g) mini portobello mushrooms, stems removed  
- 1 link Spanish-style spicy chorizo, or another spicy cured pork sausage, like pepperoni, diced  
- 3 cloves garlic, peeled  
- 1 lemon, juiced and zested  
- ¼ cup (60ml) dry white wine, such as Sauvignon Blanc  
- 3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil  
- ¼ cup fresh parsley, very finely chopped  
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Blend garlic, lemon juice, wine, and olive oil until smooth. Stir in parsley, s\&p to taste.  
2. Add mushroom caps and chorizo to a large skillet over medium heat. Season with s\&p.  
3. Cook undisturbed for \~8 minutes, until mushrooms release their juices and the chorizo is browned.  
4. Turn all the mushrooms cap-side down and place a couple of pieces of chorizo in each cap.  
5. Reduce to low. Pour a small amount of the dressing into each cap and let simmer for \~5 minutes.  
6. Transfer to a platter and serve hot with toothpicks and cold beer.

## Notes

Traditionally served with Mahou Cinco Estrellas, a Spanish pale lager. Could be paired with any other good european style pale lager, like Stella Artois or Urquell.
