# Marmalade’s White Bean Soup

*A rich, velvety white bean soup layered with smoky bacon, fresh thyme, and a finish of truffle oil. Adapted from Marmalade Restaurant in Old San Juan.*

## Ingredients

- 1 lb dried navy beans, soaked in cold water for 24 hours and drained  
- 6 slices smoked bacon  
- 1 stalk celery, chopped  
- 1 medium yellow onion, finely minced  
- 3 cloves garlic, peeled and whole  
- 1 stem fresh thyme  
- 2 liters low-sodium chicken stock  
- 1/2 stick unsalted butter  
- 1/2 cup heavy cream  
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

### For Garnish

- 2 tbsp thinly sliced fresh chives  
- 1/2 tbsp black truffle oil

## Instructions

1. Bake bacon in a single layer on a baking sheet at 400°F for \~20 minutes, or until very crispy.  
2. Pour the fat into a large dutch oven over medium-high heat.  
3. Chop the bacon into fine bits, reserving for garnish.  
4. Add celery, onion, s\&p to the pot and sauté until soft and translucent, \~5 minutes.  
5. Add garlic and thyme, sauté \~1 min, until fragrant.  
6. Add beans and stock. Bring to a boil, then simmer uncovered until fully tender, \~1.5 hours.  
7. Remove any stems and puree with an immersion blender until smooth.  
* For a silkier texture, strain through a fine-mesh sieve.  
8. Stir in the butter and heavy cream until fully incorporated. Season with s\&p to taste.  
9. Ladle the soup into warm bowls. Garnish with a drizzle of truffle oil, crispy bacon bits, and chives.

## Notes

An unoaked Chardonnay from the Burgundy region of France, such as a Chablis or Bourgogne Blanc, would complement the creamy texture and smoky flavors of the soup. The wine's acidity will cut through the richness of the dish, while its minerality will enhance the earthy notes from the beans and bacon.
